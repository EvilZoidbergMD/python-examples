    #In this tutorial, we'll set up a character on a grid, then take in commands
    #to allow it to move around. This will be a fairly complicated program, since
    #it will involve multiple types of variables, loops, conditionals, lists, and
    #functions. If you haven't already worked through the examples with those in them,
    #I would recommend doing so before you try and understand this code.
